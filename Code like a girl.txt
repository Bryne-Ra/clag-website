      <h2>Programing</h2>
      <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. 
	Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, 
	and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).
	The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, 
	rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.
	The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, 
	often for solving a given problem. 
	Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

      <h2>Programing Languages</h2>
      <p> High-level languages are designed to be easy to read and understand. This allows programmers to write source code in a natural fashion, using logical words and symbols.
	For example, reserved words like function, while, if, and else are used in most major programming languages. Symbols like <, >, ==, and != are common operators. 
	Many high-level languages are similar enough that programmers can easily understand source code written in multiple languages.
	Examples of high-level languages include C++, Java, Perl, and PHP. Languages like C++ and Java are called "compiled languages" since the source code must first be compiled in order to run. 
	Languages like Perl and PHP are called "interpreted languages" since the source code can be run through an interpreter without being compiled. Generally, 
	compiled languages are used to create software applications, while interpreted languages are used for running scripts, such as those used to generate content for dynamic websites.</p>

      <h2>Why Programing</h2>
      <p>Technology production is an essential part of an evolving world. This means that computer programming is exceptionally important for our future as a global society.
	Computer programming degree graduates can help create this future by automating processes, collecting data,
	analyzing information and sharing knowledge to continuously innovate and improve upon existing processes.

	This means that, while computer programming is extremely important today,
	it may be even more impactful in the future. As computer programmers across the world work to learn new ways of communicating with machines and computers,
	the field will continue to grow. Earning your computer programming degree now means you can be part of that research and testing to develop functions that can help society.

	Computer programming is important today because so much of our world is automated. 
	Humans need to be able to control the interaction between people and machines. Since computers and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately,
	we use computer programming to harness that computing power.</p>
